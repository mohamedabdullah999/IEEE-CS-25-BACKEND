# Laravel Eloquent Relationships and Optimization

## ðŸ”— Defining Relationships in Eloquent Models

Laravel's Eloquent ORM allows you to define relationships between tables using OOP. The main types of relationships are:

### 1. One to One

```php
// User.php
public function profile()
{
    return $this->hasOne(Profile::class);
}
```

```php
// Profile.php
public function user()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
}
```

### 2. One to Many

```php
// Post.php
public function comments()
{
    return $this->hasMany(Comment::class);
}
```

```php
// Comment.php
public function post()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(Post::class);
}
```

### 3. Many to Many

```php
// User.php
public function roles()
{
    return $this->belongsToMany(Role::class);
}
```

```php
// Role.php
public function users()
{
    return $this->belongsToMany(User::class);
}
```

## Attaching, Syncing, Detaching Related Records

In many-to-many relationships, you can use these methods to manage data in the pivot table:

### attach()

Adds a record to the pivot table without removing existing ones.

```php
$user->roles()->attach($roleId);
```

### sync()

Replaces the current relationships with the given array. Any other relationships will be removed.

```php
$user->roles()->sync([1, 2, 3]); // Removes any role not in this list
```

### detach()

Removes the relationship between records in the pivot table.

```php
$user->roles()->detach($roleId);
```

> **Note:** You can pass `null` to `detach()` to remove all relationships.

## The N+1 Query Problem in Laravel

### The Problem:

If you fetch a list of `Post` records and want to access their `comments`, Laravel will run one query for the posts and a separate query for each postâ€™s comments if accessed directly in a loop:

```php
$posts = Post::all();

foreach ($posts as $post) {
    echo $post->comments->count(); // N+1 problem here
}
```

This results in one query to get posts and N additional queries to get each post's comments = N+1 queries.

### Solution: Eager Loading

Use `with()` to load relationships up front:

```php
$posts = Post::with('comments')->get();

foreach ($posts as $post) {
    echo $post->comments->count();
}
```

> **Benefit:** Greatly improves performance especially with large databases.

# Laravel Research Summary

## What is XSRF or CSRF? Is There a Difference?

**CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** and **XSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** are actually the same thing â€” just two different names.  
It's a type of attack where malicious websites trick authenticated users into performing unwanted actions on a web application.  
Laravel protects against CSRF by automatically generating tokens for forms and verifying them on submission.
