# What are three basic types of PHP errors:

- Notice: room for improvement. This is typically caused by unset variables or missing array keys.
- Warning: errors will probably occur if not addressed.
- Error: fatal, execution terminated. Often known as the "white screen of death."

# Sensitivity in PHP.

In PHP, variable and constant names are case sensitive, while function names and class names are not.

# programming language vs scripting language

Scripting languages are used for smaller tasks, whereas programming languages help build large and complex software applications

# dynamically typed vs statically typed language.

Dynamic typing offers a breezy simplicity, allowing developers to write more concise code without the need to explicitly declare data types. In contrast, static typing often requires additional type annotations, which can make the code more verbose but also more structured

# What is the difference between assign by reference and value?

Pass-by-reference: When a method is called, the method arguments reference the same variable in memory as the caller. Pass-by-value: When a method is called, the caller passes a copy of the argument variables to the method resulting in two values in memory;

# What is the difference between for and foreach loop in PHP?

The foreach loop simplifies code that needs to operate on each element of an array. Without foreach , you would typically use a for loop, initializing a counter variable and managing the loop's conditions and increments manually. However, this can lead to more complex and error-prone code.

# Sessions vs. Cookies.

Cookies are small text files stored on the user's computer, while sessions are temporary storage mechanisms on the server side. Both cookies and sessions play a crucial role in maintaining user preferences, tracking user behavior, and enabling personalized experiences.

# Error Handling in PHP.

Error handling in PHP is simple. An error message with filename, line number and a message describing the error is sent to the browser.
When creating scripts and web applications, error handling is an important part. If your code lacks error checking code, your program may look very unprofessional and you may be open to security risks.

# How PHP Executes Code?

code execution is linear, and the compiling is carried out as well as the executing in cycles per line of a script
