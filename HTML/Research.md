# How Do Websites Work?

All websites are identified by a unique address, which tells browsers where they are located.

Simply put, when you enter a web address into your browser, it goes to that specified location and retrieves the web page. The process of retrieving this information is carried out by a web service using technologies such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and File Transfer Protocol (FTP), which essentially define how information and files are transmitted over the web.

The browser then displays the retrieved web page on your screen using technologies such as HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheet (CSS). They structure and present the web page’s information to the visitor by telling the browser exactly where to put what on the screen.

# What’s the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?

Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is a protocol or set of communication rules for client-server communication. When you visit a website, your browser sends a HTTP request to the web server, which responds with an HTTP response. The web server and your browser exchange data as plaintext. In short, HTTP protocol is the underlying technology that powers network communication. As the name suggests, hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is a more secure version or an extension of HTTP. In HTTPS, the browser and server establish a secure, encrypted connection before transferring data.

# What is web server?

A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP (the network protocol created to distribute web content) or its secure variant HTTPS. A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message. A web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.

# DNS

- The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

- Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6).
